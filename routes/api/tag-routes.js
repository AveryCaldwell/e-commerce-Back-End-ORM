//TODO:
//Fill out the unfinished routes in product-routes.js, tag-routes.js, and category-routes.js to perform create, read, update, and delete operations using your Sequelize models.
// Note that the functionality for creating the many-to-many relationship for products has already been completed for you.
// Hint: Be sure to look at the mini-project code for syntax help and use your model's column definitions to figure out what req.body will be for POST and PUT routes!
